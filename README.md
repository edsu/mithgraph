Experiments visualizing MITH's project history as a graph.

1. fetch the project data from MITH's website with [get.py](get.py) and write it
   out as [data.csv](data.csv).
2. turn the two-mode graph into two one-mode graphs with
   [project_graphs.py](project_graphs.py)
3. load the [people.csv](people.csv) and [projects.csv](projects.csv) into
   [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/) or 
   [Fusion Tables](https://fusiontables.google.com/).
